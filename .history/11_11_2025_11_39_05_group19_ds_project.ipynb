    "a. players: variables in character type and logical type are qualitative information, and the variables double types are quantitative information, but the variable in logical type could be recognized as categorical type.\n",
    "- experience: how experienced the players are in the games by classifying them into different levels: “Amateur”, “Beginner”, “Pro”, “Regular”, “Veteran”.\n",
    "- subscribe: whether players subscribe to a game-related newsletter, indicated with TRUE and FALSE\n",
    "- hashedEmail: players’ email address\n",
    "- played_hours: players’ total playing durations in the server in hours\n",
    "- name: name of players\n",
    "- gender: gender of players\n",
    "- Age: age of players\n",
    "\n",
    "- In sessions, hashEmail is qualitative information, which are the emails of the players in the recorded session; there are start time and end time in character type indicated the exact date and time of the sessions start and end with human-readable format, original start time and original end time are in double type that are not readable by users.\n",
    "- hashedEmail: players’ email address\n",
    "- start_time: start time of each play session in **date format** (dd/mm/yyyy & time)\n",
    "- end_time: end time of each play session in **date format** (dd/mm/yyyy & time)\n",
    "- original_start_time: start time of each play session in **seconds**\n",
    "- original_end_time: end time of each play session in **seconds**\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Any issues you see in the data\n",
    "- The started time and end time in sessions.csv are in character type not double type, and there are no column about the total spend time of each session.\n",
    "- Some variables are not useful for investigating the questions and the data should be wrangled.\n",
    "- “Age” in players.csv includes “N/A”\n",
    "- In experience (players.csv) for “Pro” & “Amateur” differences are so large (14 & 63), which may make “Pro” category underrepresents\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Any other potential issues related to things you cannot directly see\n",
    "- The information provided by players could be inaccurate, such as experience, there could be different counting methods across players to determine they belong to which level, which leads to information is not very accurate for comparison. \n",
    "\n",
    "8. How the data were collected\n",
    "- The research group records players' gameplay, speech, and key presses in the PLAICraft Minecraft browser window to collect the data.\n"
